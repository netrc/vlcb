p.viii - [a quote from Mentor Mr. J. Lewis Andr√©] "The brasses of England are a priceless treasure.... Religio, art, costume, heraldry, language, manners, and customs, all find exemplification in these simple plates of metal."

p.viii-ix - [two other observations to add:] "First, there is no other country in Europe which contains anything approaching the number of brasses to be found in England. Even one county alone, Norfolk, contains in itself more than the total number surviving on the Continent. Second, even in England, there remain perhaps only a tenth of what were originally laid down. Iconoclastic zeal, carelessness, and theft have left most of the indents bare. We may count ourselves fortunate that so many old brasses remain in our churches, and these we ought to cherish with intelligent appreciation."

p.x - "The day of actual brass-rubbing as a hobby is perhaps over. Many of our finest brasses are now jealously guarded, and their rubbbing is in some instances rightly prohibited. Here and there, brasses have a sheet of plate-glass padlocked over them. Good cobbler's heelball for rubbing purposes is also now almost unobtainable."

p.x - "One error on the part of collectors should in any case be pointed out. We were often told in the old days to cut out our rubings and mount them either on monochrome paper or on linen. For purposes of exhibition or decoration this was all very well, but as a record it was faulty. We now realize that if rubbing ever is carrour out, it should involve taking an impression of the *whole* slab, so that the indents of any missing parts (whatever they may be, whether limbs, shields, canopies, inscripptions, or other accessories) are duly reproduced"

p.2 - "It may safely be said that in no religion other than Christianity do we find quite such a wealth and variety of tombs and monuments to separate individuals of all classes"
